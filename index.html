                <p>
                    Currently enrolled in coding bootcamp at UTSA. My ultimate goal is to eventually work my way into 
                    becoming a software engineer. As of now (2022) I am working at a company called Safesite, a business that offers
                    offsite storage for important files as well as shredding services. I love my current job and will be forever grafeful
                    for the many friendships Safesite has given me. However, I do feel that it is time to start getting serious about what I 
                    am going to be doing with my future. Fortunately for me though is that I have been in love with web development from the start. 
                    I'm excited & curious what the future has in store!
