## My Portfolio

### this website will be a portfolio of other projects I am working on or have done. It will also be used to display my resume & show contact info. **NOTE!!!** This website is far from complete. As I am under time crunch I have done my best to get at least acceptance critia done. I am still new to this and have complete written this thing from scratch. Many things still need to be fixed especially media queries & resizing in css using "flex" but most imptortantly the links I have used to display parts of my work section ARE NOT MINE!! I DO NOT OWN any of the games or websites i have currently link to this website, and have only used the links as placeholders for right now. You can access my portfolio using this link....   https://itsmarcotime.github.io/Challenge-2-portfolio/
